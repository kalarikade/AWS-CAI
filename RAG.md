Retrieval Augmented Generation, is a powerful technique that enhaces the capabilites of large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external knowledge sources.

Traditional LLMs rely solely on their internal knowledge, which can be liimited and outdated.

RAG overcomes this limitation by retrieving relevant information from external sources like databases, documets, oor the web during the generation process.

## Why RAG
* *Limited Knowledge*: LLMs are trained on a fixed dataset, making them susceptible to outdated or incomplete information.
* *Hallucinations:* LLMs can generate plausible-sounding but incorrectt or nonsensical information, especially when faced with ambiguous queries or unfamiliar topics.
* *Lack of Contextual Awareness*: LLMs may strugggle to understand the specific context of a query, leading to irrelevant or inaccurate responses.
* *RAG Addresses* these limitations by providing acces to up-to-date and contextually relevant information, improving the accuracy and reliability of LLM-generated outputs.
