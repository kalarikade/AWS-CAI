***Machine Learning*** is a branch of AI, which can learn from data and iteratively improve without being explicitly programmed.

### How does it learn?
Just as a child learns to balance by trying and falling, ML algorithms learn by adjusting their parameters based on feedback.

### Key Components of ML
**Data**: The fuel for learning providing examples & patterns
**Features**: The specific attributes of the data that the model focuses on.
**Algorithm**: The recipe for how the model learns and updates itself.

### Key Components (with eg)
Imagine we want to predict house prices using machine learning. Here's how the key components come into play.
<!--ID: 1751612412076-->


**==Data==** A collection of information about houses, including:
	* Square Footage
	* No.of bedrooms & bathrooms
	* Location
	* Sale Price*

**==Features==** The specific attributes we'll use to make predictions:
	* Square Footage
	* No. of bedrooms
	* No. of bathrooms
	* Location ( we might convert this to a numerical value representing desirabillity.*
**==Algorithm==** The machine learning model we choose (e.g, linear regression, decision tree, neural network) will use these features to learn the relationship between them and the sale price. 
Over time, it will get better at predicting prices for new houses based on their features.
