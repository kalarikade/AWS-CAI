## Text-to-Image Models
==Generating images from textual descriptions
*Capabilities*
* Creating realistic & imaginative images
* Modifying existing images based on text prompts
* Generating images in different styles & formats*
==Examples on AWS: Stable Diffusion==
*Use cases: Education, E-commerce, Design & Creativity.*

## Multi-Modal Models
 * Combining different data modalities, such as text and images, to perform more complex tasks.
 * Capabilities:
	 * Image captioning: Generating textual description of images
	 * Visual question answering: Answering questions about images
	 * Image-to-text generation: Creating text based on images.
* ==Examples:== Flamingo, CLIP(While these specific models might not be directly available, AWS provides the infrastructure and tools to build and deploy similar multi-modal models.)

A common metric used for evaluating text generation tasks is ==BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)==. BLEU is a widely used metric, particularly for machine translation, that measures the similarity between a generated text and a reference text by analyzing the overlap of n-grams.
