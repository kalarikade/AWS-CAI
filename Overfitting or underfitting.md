## Overfitting
Your model is overfitting your training data when it performs well on the training data but it doesn't perform well on the evaluation data. 
Overfitting is where the model learns the particulars of a data set too well. It's esentially memoriizng the training data insteead of actually learning the relationships between features and labels. It's important for the odel to learn th relationships and labels so that it can applyl what it learns to new data in the future.

## Underfitting
Your model is underfitting the training data when the model performs poorly in the training data The model can't capture the relationship between the input examples(often called x ) and the target values (often called y). This inability causes the underfitting.
