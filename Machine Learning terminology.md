## Model
A model in machine learning is the trained algorithm that you se to identify patters in your data. A model is trained through the machie learning process and captures and stores patterns. The more patterns a model stors the bogger it will become. Typically described in megabytes. 
The purpose of a model is to predict outcomes to new data inputs, based on previously observed patterns.

## Training Algorithm
In Machine learning, you ca use training algorithms to help you accomplish empirical tasks that require some sort of inductive inference. This objective involves induction because it uses data to train algorithms to make generalizable inferences. Thus, algorithms can make statistically reliable predictionns or decisions, or complete other tasks, when they apply new data that was not used to train them. An algorithm-trained algorithmm identifies patterns in your data without requiring any explicit, manually set rules.
