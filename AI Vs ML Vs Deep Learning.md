==**Artificial Intelligence**==: The broadest, encompassing any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence. This includes areas like problem-solving, reasoning, learning & perception.

**==Machine Learning==**: A subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for the task.

**==Deep Learning==**: A specialized subset of M that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep) to analyze and learn complex patterns in data.
