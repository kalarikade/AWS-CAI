* Bedrock Agents go beyond just providing access to Foundation Models (FMs). They provide a way to build fully functional AI agents that can complete tasks and engage in complex interactions. 

 Key components include:
 * Foundation Models : Leverage the power of FMs for natural language understanding, text generation & other capabilities.
 * Actions : Agents can perform actions like making API calls, querying databases, or interacting with other systems. 
 * Memory: Agents can retain information from previous interactions to provide context and personalize the experience.

## Why Use Bedrock Agents
* **Faster Development**: Streamline the process of building AI-powered applications
* **Reduced Complexity**: Abstract away the complexities of managing infrastructure and integrating different services.
* **Improved User Experience**: Create more engaging and interactive AI experiences.

## Advanced Agent Customization
**Custom Actions**: Develop your own actions using AWS Lambda functions for more complex integrations.
**Fine-tuned Models**: Use fine-tuned foundation models to improve agent performance for specific tasks.
