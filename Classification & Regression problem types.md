## Binary Classifications
Binary Classifications target a variable as belonging in one class or another. For example a variable is limited on one of two options: it is either true or false. 
The next example: You are classifying an observation into one of two categories to determine whether the variable is fraudulent or not. It is true fraudulent or false fraudulent. 

## Multiclass Classification
Classifies an observation into one of three categories. Suppose you have an ML model that predicts why a customer is calling your store. Its purpose is to reduce the number of transfers necessary before getting the customer to the correct customer support department. In this case, the different customer support departments represent the various potential target variables - which might be different departments. 

## Regression 
Regression classification models map inputs to a continous value, like an integer. One example of an ML tegression problem is predictiong the price of a company's stock. For instance, a regression based on algorithm would predict that tomorrow the stock pri e for a company could go up from $113 per share to $127 per share.
